# üîç How to test?

- Use http://localhost:4000/ to work with GraphQL
- Use Mutation `registerUser` to add new user to database. You can use the following body:

```js
{
  "firstName": "My First Name",
  "lastName": "My Last Name",
  "email": "firstname@gmail.com",
  "password": "12345678",
}
```

- Use Query `loginUser` to receive JWT token. It will work 24 hours

```js
{
  "email": "firstname@gmail.com",
  "password": "12345678",
}
```

- Set JWT token to Headers:
